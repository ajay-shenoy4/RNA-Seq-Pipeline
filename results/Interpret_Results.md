# Results Interpretation Guide

This guide explains how to interpret the visualizations and data generated by the RNA-seq differential expression pipeline.

## Overview

The analysis identified **5,155 significantly differentially expressed genes** (FDR < 0.05) between DUS1L knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) conditions, demonstrating substantial transcriptomic reprogramming in response to DUS1L loss.

## 1. Sample Quality & Reproducibility

### PCA Plot (`salmon_pca_plot.pdf`)

**What it shows**: Principal Component Analysis visualizes genome-wide expression patterns in two dimensions.

**How to interpret**:
- **PC1 (x-axis)**: Captures the largest source of variation in the data
  - Clear separation between WT (left) and KO (right) samples indicates biological condition is the primary driver
  - **>50% variance** on PC1 suggests strong, consistent biological effect
- **PC2 (y-axis)**: Secondary variation (technical factors, individual differences)
- **Sample clustering**: Tight grouping within each condition demonstrates high replicate concordance

**Quality metrics**:
-  **Good**: WT and KO samples form distinct, tight clusters -> Observed
-  **Warning**: Overlapping clusters may indicate weak biological effect or batch effects
-  **Poor**: Samples cluster by replicate rather than condition (suggests technical issues)

**Your results**: Strong PC1 separation validates the biological impact of DUS1L knockout.

### Sample Distance Heatmap (`salmon_sample_distance_heatmap.pdf`)

**What it shows**: Pairwise Euclidean distances between all samples across the entire transcriptome.

**How to interpret**:
- **Color scale**: Blue (high similarity) → White (dissimilar)
- **Diagonal blocks**: Two 3×3 dark blue squares indicate:
  - WT samples are highly similar to each other
  - KO samples are highly similar to each other
- **Off-diagonal regions**: Lighter colors between WT and KO show distinct transcriptomic states

**Quality indicator**: Clear block structure = excellent biological replicate reproducibility.

**Statistical note**: Distances are computed as:
```
distance = sqrt(sum((gene_expr_sample1 - gene_expr_sample2)^2))
```

## 2. Differential Expression Patterns

### Enhanced Volcano Plot (`salmon_volcano_plot.pdf`)

**What it shows**: Statistical significance vs. biological effect size for all genes, **with top genes labeled by symbol**.

**Key features**:
- **X-axis**: log₂ fold change (KO vs WT)
  - Right: Upregulated in KO (2,533 genes)
  - Left: Downregulated in KO (2,622 genes)
- **Y-axis**: -log₁₀(p-value) — higher = more significant
- **Colors**:
  -  **Red**: Upregulated (log₂FC > 1, padj < 0.05)
  -  **Blue**: Downregulated (log₂FC < -1, padj < 0.05)
  -  **Orange**: Significant but moderate effect (|log₂FC| < 1)
  -  **Gray**: Not significant

**Special labels**:
- **DUS1L**: Should appear far left (downregulated), confirming knockout success
- **Top genes**: Most extreme or significant genes are automatically labeled
  - Look for known stress response genes (HSPs, ATF4)
  - Novel genes may represent undiscovered DUS1L pathway components

**How to read log₂FC**:
| log₂FC | Fold Change | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| +1 | 2× higher in KO | Moderate upregulation |
| +2 | 4× higher in KO | Strong upregulation |
| -1 | 2× lower in KO | Moderate downregulation |
| -3 | 8× lower in KO | Severe downregulation |

**Biological insights**:
- **Symmetric "V" shape**: Balanced up/down-regulation suggests coordinated reprogramming
- **Asymmetric**: Skewed distribution may indicate:
  - Transcriptional activation (more upregulated genes)
  - Loss of repressor function (more downregulated genes)

---

### MA Plot (`salmon_ma_plot.pdf`)

**What it shows**: Relationship between expression level and fold change.

**Axes**:
- **X-axis**: log₁₀(mean expression) — how abundant is the gene?
- **Y-axis**: log₂ fold change — how much does it change?

**What to look for**:
1. **Horizontal scatter**: Points should be randomly distributed around y=0
   -  Indicates unbiased normalization
   -  Curved patterns suggest batch effects or normalization issues
2. **Red points**: Significantly DE genes (padj < 0.05)
3. **Low-expression genes**: Left side often has higher variance (expected)

**Quality check**: If highly expressed genes (right side) show systematic bias, revisit normalization.

## 3. Top Gene Expression Patterns

### Annotated Heatmap with GO Terms (`salmon_top50_genes_heatmap.pdf`)

**What it shows**: Expression patterns for the 50 most significantly DE genes, **with functional annotations**.

**Layout**:
- **Rows**: Individual genes (labeled by gene symbol)
- **Columns**: Individual samples (3 WT, 3 KO)
- **Colors**:
  -  **Red**: High expression (z-score > 0)
  -  **Blue**: Low expression (z-score < 0)
  -  **White**: Average expression

**Annotations**:
- **Top bar (Condition)**: Sample groups (WT vs KO)
- **Side bar (Process)**: Gene Ontology biological process enrichment
  - Genes with similar functions cluster together
  - Example: "RNA processing", "Cell cycle", "Immune response"

**How to interpret clustering**:
1. **Horizontal clustering** (samples):
   - Clear separation between WT and KO validates differential expression
2. **Vertical clustering** (genes):
   - Gene modules with similar expression patterns
   - Co-regulated genes often share biological functions

**Example patterns**:
```
Gene Module 1 (Red in WT, Blue in KO):
├── GENE_A: "mRNA splicing"
├── GENE_B: "RNA processing"  
└── GENE_C: "nuclear transport"
→ Interpretation: RNA processing pathway suppressed in KO

Gene Module 2 (Blue in WT, Red in KO):
├── GENE_X: "stress response"
├── GENE_Y: "DNA damage repair"
└── GENE_Z: "apoptosis"
→ Interpretation: Stress pathways activated in KO
```

**Finding DUS1L**:
- Look for genes with **extreme downregulation** (dark blue in KO)
- DUS1L should be among the top downregulated genes
- Genes clustered with DUS1L may be functionally related

## 5. Biological Summary

### Overall Statistics

| Metric | Value | % of Expressed Genes |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Total genes analyzed** | 22,213 | 100% |
| **Significantly DE** | 5,155 | 23.2% |
| **Upregulated in KO** | 2,533 | 11.4% |
| **Downregulated in KO** | 2,622 | 11.8% |
| **High magnitude (±2 log₂FC)** | ~800 | 3.6% |

### Key Validation Points

**DUS1L depletion confirmed**
- Target gene shows expected strong downregulation
- log₂FC < -5 indicates successful knockout

**High statistical power**
- 5,155 DE genes at stringent FDR < 0.05
- Clear separation in all QC plots

**Balanced transcriptional response**
- Nearly equal up/down-regulation (51% vs 49%)
- Suggests coordinated cellular reprogramming rather than general stress

**Strong biological replicates**
- Tight PCA clustering
- Clear heatmap block structure
- Low technical variation

### Biological Interpretation

**The large-scale transcriptomic changes indicate DUS1L is a master regulator affecting:**

1. **Direct targets**: Genes immediately downstream of DUS1L function
2. **Compensatory responses**: Upregulated pathways attempting to compensate for DUS1L loss
3. **Secondary effects**: Cascade of changes as cells adapt to altered state

**Expected pathway enrichments** (to be confirmed with GO analysis):
- **Downregulated**: RNA processing, splicing, translation (DUS1L's known functions)
- **Upregulated**: Stress response, unfolded protein response, cell cycle checkpoints

## 6. Next Steps for Analysis

### Immediate Follow-ups

1. **Gene Ontology Enrichment**
```r
   library(clusterProfiler)
   up_genes <- rownames(res)[res$log2FoldChange > 0 & res$padj < 0.05]
   ego_up <- enrichGO(gene = up_genes, OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, ont = "BP")
```

2. **KEGG Pathway Analysis**
   - Identify affected cellular pathways
   - Compare with published DUS1L studies

3. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**
   - Rank all genes by stat or log₂FC
   - Test for coordinated pathway changes

4. **Validation Experiments**
   - qRT-PCR on top 10 DE genes
   - Western blot for protein-level confirmation
   - Functional rescue experiments

### Advanced Analyses

- **Protein-protein interaction networks** (STRING, BioGRID)
- **Transcription factor binding site enrichment** (HOMER, MEME)
- **Time-series analysis** (if data available)
- **Single-cell decomposition** (if heterogeneous cell population)

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Samples don't cluster by condition in PCA
- **Possible causes**: Weak biological effect, batch effects, sample swaps
- **Solutions**: Check sample metadata, run batch correction (ComBat), verify experimental design

**Issue**: Few/no significantly DE genes
- **Causes**: Low replicate number, high biological variability, conservative filtering
- **Solutions**: Increase sample size, relax padj threshold (0.1), check power analysis

**Issue**: DUS1L not downregulated
- **Causes**: Knockout incomplete, wrong gene annotation, RNA rescue
- **Solutions**: Verify genotype, check protein levels, review experimental protocol
